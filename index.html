        <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach 
            <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability
             to take comand of your computer and get it to do your bidding. We believe there are 
            <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, 
             probably more. To join our movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our
